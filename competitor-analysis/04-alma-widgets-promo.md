## Color Usage
- **Page background**: warm beige/cream (same as the Alma dashboard — consistent brand palette)

- **"How to add a widget"**: medium (~16–17px), bold, left-aligned section header
- **Font**: same humanist sans-serif as the rest of Alma — warm and rounded

## Patterns & Components
- **Hero preview card**: large rounded card (~20px radius) containing a device screenshot — the widget in context
- **Numbered instruction cards**: cards with large screenshots showing each step, numbered with a badge overlay
- **Step badge**: small circle in top-left corner with step number — clear sequential flow
- **Consistent card treatment**: same rounded corners and cream/beige card style as the rest of the app
- **In-context screenshots**: showing the actual iOS home screen makes the feature tangible and relatable

## Design Principles Observed
1. **Show, don't tell**: the hero card immediately shows the widget in context on an iOS home screen
2. **Progressive instruction**: numbered steps provide a clear, sequential guide
3. **Consistent brand language**: same warm beige palette, card styling, and typography as the main app
4. **Minimal UI chrome**: the nav bar is simple, letting the content breathe
5. **Visual proof**: using real-looking iOS screenshots builds trust and clarity
6. **Rounded, soft aesthetic**: large corner radii and warm colors maintain the friendly, approachable brand
